## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Georgia (3.61 GPA, Graduating Spring 2026), focusing on networking-focused Java development and building distributed systems that connect and scale.

Currently working on **SwiftCast**, a browser that enables casting any video content by intercepting HLS/DASH streams and relaying them to Chromecast.
